    <!-- Set to true if the wifi display supports compositing content stored
         in gralloc protected buffers.  For this to be true, there must exist
         a protected hardware path for surface flinger to composite and send
         protected buffers to the wifi display video encoder.
         If this flag is false, we advise applications not to use protected
         buffers (if possible) when presenting content to a wifi display because
         the content may be blanked.
         This flag controls whether the {@link Display#FLAG_SUPPORTS_PROTECTED_BUFFERS}
         flag is set for wifi displays.
