    <!-- Array of light sensor LUX values to define our levels for auto backlight brightness support.
         The N entries of this array define N  1 zones as follows:
         Zone 0:        0 <= LUX < array[0]
         Zone 1:        array[0] <= LUX < array[1]
         ...
         Zone N:        array[N - 1] <= LUX < array[N]
         Zone N + 1     array[N] <= LUX < infinity
         Must be overridden in platform specific overlays -->
