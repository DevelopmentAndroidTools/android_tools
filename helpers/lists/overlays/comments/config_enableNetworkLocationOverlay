    <!-- Whether to enable network location overlay which allows network
         location provider to be replaced by an app at run-time. When disabled,
         only the config_networkLocationProviderPackageName package will be
         searched for network location provider, otherwise packages whose
         signature matches the signatures of config_locationProviderPackageNames
         will be searched, and the service with the highest version number will
         be picked. Anyone who wants to disable the overlay mechanism can set it
         to false.
