    <!-- Array of ambient lux threshold values. This is used for determining hysteresis constraint
         values by calculating the index to use for lookup and then setting the constraint value
         to the corresponding value of the array. The new brightening hysteresis constraint value
         is the n-th element of config_dynamicHysteresisBrightLevels, and the new darkening
         hysteresis constraint value is the n-th element of config_dynamicHysteresisDarkLevels.
         The (zero-based) index is calculated as follows: (MAX is the largest index of the array)
         condition                      calculated index
         value < lux[0]                 0
         lux[n] <= value < lux[n+1]     n+1
         lux[MAX] <= value              MAX+1 -->
