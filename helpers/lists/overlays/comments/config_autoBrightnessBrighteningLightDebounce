    <!-- Stability requirements in milliseconds for accepting a new brightness level.  This is used
         for debouncing the light sensor.  Different constants are used to debounce the light sensor
         when adapting to brighter or darker environments.  This parameter controls how quickly
         brightness changes occur in response to an observed change in light level that exceeds the
         hysteresis threshold. -->
