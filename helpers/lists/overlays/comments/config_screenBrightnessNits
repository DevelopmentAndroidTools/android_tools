    <!-- An array of floats describing the screen brightness in nits corresponding to the backlight
         values in the config_screenBrightnessBacklight array.  On OLED displays these  values
         should be measured with an all white image while the display is in the fully on state.
         Note that this value should *not* reflect the maximum brightness value for any high
         brightness modes but only the maximum brightness value obtainable in a sustainable manner.
         This array should be equal in size to config_screenBrightnessBacklight -->
