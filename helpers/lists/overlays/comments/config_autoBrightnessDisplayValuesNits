    <!-- Array of desired screen brightness in nits corresponding to the lux values
         in the config_autoBrightnessLevels array. As with config_screenBrightnessMinimumNits and
         config_screenBrightnessMaximumNits, the display brightness is defined as the measured
         brightness of an all-white image.
         If this is defined then:
            - config_autoBrightnessLcdBacklightValues should not be defined
            - config_screenBrightnessNits must be defined
            - config_screenBrightnessBacklight must be defined
         This array should have size one greater than the size of the config_autoBrightnessLevels
         array. The brightness values must be non-negative and non-decreasing. This must be
         overridden in platform specific overlays -->
