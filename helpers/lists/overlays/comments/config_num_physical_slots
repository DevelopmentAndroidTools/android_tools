    <!-- Number of physical SIM slots on the device. This includes both eSIM and pSIM slots, and
         is not necessarily the same as the number of phones/logical modems supported by the device.
         For example, a multi-sim device can have 2 phones/logical modems, but 3 physical slots,
         or a single SIM device can have 1 phones/logical modems, but 2 physical slots (one eSIM
         and one pSIM) -->
